## Snarkaup

This e-commerce website is a hobby project collaboration with [Andri Rafn](https://github.com/AndriRafnR) ü§ù
<br>Andri built the backend with [Vercel's Postgres solution](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres)

<br> I built the frontend with:

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- DatoCMS

We used this free [design](https://www.figma.com/file/S2qa5zFljHDDKLOdP50Dpo/3legant-E-Commerce-UI-Design-Template-(Community)?node-id=3%3A674&mode=dev) as a blueprint but added our personal flair and preferences here and there
